      <h2>Where did it all start?</h2>
      <p>Born January 17th, 1706 on Milk Street in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. Born the son of a candle maker young Benjamin was one of seventeen children amongst the Franklin household. No stranger to struggle or hardship Ben's childhood would shape him into the young man he would become. </p>
      <p> Relying heavily on furthering his education through self study Ben put a hold on formal education at a young age and instead at only the age of 12 focused on his apprenticeship working for his older brother James, learning the printing industry. Little did he know at the time but this would prove pivotal in his overall development and outreach as he grew.

      <h2>An Aspiring Inventor</h2>
      <p>While Benjamin Franklin was quite successful in his work and time spent working in the printing industry, he is perhaps most reknown for his work as an inventor. Inventing the lightning rod, glass harmonica, Franklin stove, bifocal glasses, and flexible urinary catheter his contributions and creations became of great benefit to many across the world.</p>
      <p>When picturing the Founding Father, one image in particular that usually comes to mind is the iconic flying of a kite during an electrical storm. While this story is ficticious and did not happen quite as depicted Ben's work in the advancement and practical understanding of electricity would prove monumental in it's later advancement.

      <h2>A Founding Father</h2>
      <p>Ben's work as an author, an inventor, would seem as if this would have been enough to suffice the life that was Bejamin Franklin's, but his passion, pursuit, and fight for change in local and national government are still seen to this very day. As a key member in the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution we owe muc to the legacy that was Benjamin Franklin. </p>
